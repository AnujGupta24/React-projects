## Development Process

### 1. Project Setup

  ```sh
  npx create-react-app my-portfolio
  ```
- Installed dependencies:
  ```sh
  npm install react-router-dom tailwindcss @headlessui/react
  ```
- Configured Tailwind CSS:
  ```sh
  npx tailwindcss init -p
  ```

### 2. Folder Structure
```
my-portfolio/
â”‚-- src/
â”‚   â”‚-- components/
â”‚   â”‚-- pages/
â”‚   â”‚-- assets/
â”‚   â”‚-- App.jsx

â”‚   â”‚-- styles.css
â”‚-- public/
â”‚-- package.json
â”‚-- tailwind.config.js
â”‚-- README.md
```

### 3. Development & Testing
- Used **React Router** for navigation
- Applied **lazy loading** for performance optimization
- Tested components using Jest & React Testing Library
  ```sh
  npm test
  ```

### 4. Building the Project

  ```sh
  npm run build
  ```

  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit"
  git branch -M main
  git remote add origin https://github.com/AnujGupta24/my-portfolio.git
  git push -u origin main
  ```

## Challenges & Solutions

### **1. Git Not Tracking the Project Folder**
- Issue: Git ignored the `my-portfolio` folder when committing.
- Solution: Manually navigated into the folder and initialized Git inside it.
  ```sh
  cd my-portfolio
  git init
  ```

### **2. Deployment Issues on Netlify**
- Issue: Netlify build failed due to missing dependencies.
- Solution: Installed all dependencies again and set the correct build command.
  ```sh
  npm install
  ```

### **3. Testing Errors**
- Issue: `expect` and `test` were not recognized.
- Solution: Installed Jest properly and checked test configurations.
  ```sh
  npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
  ```
